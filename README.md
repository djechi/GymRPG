## Inspiration
As an avid gym goer, I understand how hard it is for beginners to get into the gym and stay consistent. Many beginners don't know what workouts they should do and may become unmotivated to work out once they sign up for a gym membership. 

## What it does
GymRPG is a website that offers users the ability to create and generate their own routine based on their preferences by making use of Gemini AI. In addition, the website acts as a gym progress tracking system and motivator to help users stay consistent throughout their journey. This system is designed with a fantasy and RPG theme in mind to make progress feel like playing a video game.

## How we built it
We built the website using Python/Flask for the back end to retrieve the gemini api, and we used React/Tailwindcss/Next.js in the front end to fetch calls from the backend Rest API.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges that we ran into was learning how to test the Gemini chatbot using Postman.
